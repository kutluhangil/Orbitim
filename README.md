### **The solar system where it actually is right now.**
### Real ephemeris, live orbital elements, NASA imagery — in a browser tab, with nothing behind it.

## ✦ What is Orbitim?

**Orbitim** is a real-time 3D solar system that runs entirely in the browser. Eighteen
bodies — the Sun, eight planets and nine major moons — are placed by orbital mechanics
rather than by hand, for the exact instant on the clock. Fly to any of them, scrub the
clock forward a decade, and the geometry you see is the geometry the sky will hold.

Beyond the planets, the system is filled in with the objects that actually share it: five
comets riding their real orbits with a tail that only unfurls near the Sun, the named
dwarf planets and the largest asteroids, and the main belt between Mars and Jupiter with
its Kirkwood gaps.

Around Earth, up to seventeen constellations of tracked objects are propagated from real
orbital elements at frame rate: space stations, Starlink, GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou,
OneWeb, Iridium NEXT, geostationary, weather, science, Earth observation, the brightest
objects, and the four great orbital-debris clouds — Iridium 33, Cosmos 2251, Fengyun 1C
and Cosmos 1408.

**No backend. No API keys. No accounts.** Static files, a fetch for orbital elements, and
your GPU. Any view is a link: the Share button copies the exact instant, rate and
constellations so someone else opens on the same sky.

> **Nothing on screen is simulated telemetry.** Where a value is undefined for a body,
> the panel says so instead of inventing one.

## ⚡ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🪐 **Real positions** | VSOP87 and the lunar theory via `astronomy-engine`; moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and Neptune from parent-relative elements |
| 🛰️ **Live satellites** | CelesTrak element sets, SGP4-propagated in the browser each frame, 17 switchable groups with live object counts, including four real debris clouds |
| ☄️ **Comets & minor planets** | Halley, Encke, 67P, Hale–Bopp and NEOWISE on their JPL orbits; the named dwarf planets and largest asteroids on theirs |
| 🕰️ **Scrubbable clock** | Pause, run at rate, or jump to any instant — every position, distance and phase angle follows |
| 🔗 **Shareable moments** | The Share button copies a link to the exact instant, rate and constellations on screen |
| 🚀 **Cinematic flight** | Camera state machine: overview → flying → orbiting, with `Escape` as the way back out |
| 🏷️ **Collision-free labels** | Screen-space planet labels laid out in one pass, so the inner planets never stack into an unreadable pile |
| ☀️ **Living photosphere** | The Sun's surface is a GLSL shader: drifting granulation over the published map, plus a camera-facing corona sprite |
| 💍 **Physical rings** | Saturn's shadow cast across its own ring plane, sub-texture ringlet structure, and forward scattering when the Sun sits behind |
| 🌫️ **Atmospheres** | Limb shells only where a world actually has one — Venus opaque, Mars thin, the ice giants deep; Mercury and the moons get none |
| ✨ **Deep sky** | A dimmed Milky Way plate behind 9,000 deterministic point stars, coloured across the main sequence |
| 📊 **Live dossier** | Distance, light travel time, apparent magnitude, illuminated fraction — all computed at render time from the same ephemeris |
| 🖼️ **8K on approach** | 2K maps for everything visible, an 8K map only for the body you are flying to, released when you leave |
| 📐 **Honest geometry** | Distances are log-compressed to fit one screen; directions are never distorted, so conjunctions stay truthful |

## 📏 Scale

True scale is unusable — at Neptune's real distance the Earth is far below one pixel.
Orbital radii are logarithmically compressed and body radii follow a gentler compression,
so Jupiter still dwarfs Mercury and the whole system reads on one screen. Directions are
never distorted: conjunctions and alignments are geometrically truthful.

```
auToScene(au)   →  ORBIT_BASE · au^(1-0.62) · (1 + 0.62·log₁₀(1+au))
radiusOf(km)    →  EARTH_SCENE_RADIUS · (km / R⊕)^0.45
```

All of it lives in one file: `src/lib/scale.ts`.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Flow is one-way: **ephemeris → scale → scene**. Astronomy code never returns three.js
types, so it can be verified without rendering anything.

## 🌐 Orbital element pipeline

Element sets are fetched per constellation, not all at once, and each step degrades to the
next with the reason recorded on the result:

| Step | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `localStorage` cache | Reused for 2 hours, so a reload costs no network |
| 2 | Satvisor CDN mirror of CelesTrak | Primary path; avoids CelesTrak rate limits |
| 3 | CelesTrak `gp.php` directly | Used when the mirror is unavailable; 403 is surfaced, not hidden |
| 4 | Embedded fallback set | ISS, Tiangong, HST, a GPS bird — so the layer is never empty |

Each result carries its own `source` (`live` · `cache` · `local_fallback` · `hardcoded_fallback`),
so the UI can always say where a position came from.

## 🚀 Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build
npm run preview
npm run lint      # oxlint
```

No environment variables, no `.env`, nothing to provision.

## ⚙️ Performance

| Concern | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Texture memory** | 2K everywhere, 8K only for the flight target, disposed on departure |
| **Bundle** | `three`, `astronomy-engine` and `satellite.js` split into their own vendor chunks — app rebuilds don't invalidate ~1.3 MB of cached script |
| **Star field** | One `Points` draw call for 9,000 stars, deterministic hash instead of `Math.random`, no per-frame allocation |
| **Satellites** | One points buffer per group, written in place each frame — a whole constellation is a single draw call; groups are opt-in and counted |
| **Frame loop** | Scratch vectors and quaternions allocated once per component, reused every frame |
